{% trans "The Rmap4RainBO application is moreover an experimental platform addressing citizens and institutions with the aim to gather feedback on the territory in terms of observed  impacts (section 'IMPACT / Add Impact') due to hydraulic hydrogeological weather events (eg floods, fallen trees or icy road). The impact codification, so far considered in the present application, has been defined within the project, since any code of them has not yet been found at regional or national level, but it can obviously be reviewed and updated after further comparisons with the competent institutions. The goal is to start building a database of historical data on the recorded impacts in order to correlate them to regional meteorological alerts. The weather phenomena codification is based on the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.html'>WMO â€“ World Meteorological Organization</a> standards." %}
